                        I have this Doctor Plague Bird that I bought from the 
                        Squishables stall at the Union Square Holiday Market!! I went
                        because it was a fun place to visit and make fun of the weird stuff
                        people sell there and I saw this bird and thought it was actually 
                        really cute. It was pricy, like everything else sold there, but it made 
                        me happy. It's just a little stuffed bird plush, but it's very important
                        to me because it is the first purchase I made for myself in NYC that wasn't
                        a food/lifestyle item. Later on, I also found out that Florence Pugh 
                        went to the exact same squishables stand in the Union Square Holiday Market
                        which was extra exciting!!

                        Ever since I was little, my family has had this pink "Happy Birthday" banner that
                        we hang up somewhere in the house for each of our birthdays. Whether it is hung up 
                        in the background of my birthday photo or just hung up across the wall, this banner
                        has been in my life for a long time. This year, since I am in New York City away from
                        home, my parents sent me the banner to hang up in my dorm room here. Of course it 
                        isn't the same, but it was nice to have something familiar hanging up in my room during
                        my birthday.

                        When I went on vacation to San Diego, the condo we stayed at
                        didn’t have enough mugs. So, I went in search of one to use for my weeklong trip
                        and that I really liked and was functional in price, size, 
                        shape and color. I found this mug at a Dunkin’ Donuts store on 
                        clearance because it was a holiday edition cup being sold during the summer.
                        I brought the mug home with me and I love to use it because it reminds me of 
                        the wonderful memories from that trip.

                        Growing up in Hong Kong, I used to ride the double-decker 
                        tram with my family to go places on the weekend. The trams are 
                        also known as “Ding Ding” because of the distinctive sound they 
                        make as they approach the platform. I used to love riding on the 
                        top deck of the tram and enjoy the scenery above all the bustling 
                        activities at the street level. I bought this toy tram years later 
                        during a visit back in Hong Kong, and it always reminds me of the good times living in 
                        Hong Kong as a young child!

                        I have had this small tile sample since 1994. That summer, 
                        I interned at an architectural firm, and one of my 
                        responsibilities was to contact manufacturers and request 
                        samples for the office product library. At the end of my 
                        internship, I wanted a small memento to remember my first 
                        professional job, and this was the only sample I kept with me. 
                        I have taken this tile sample with me to every office I’ve worked 
                        at since then, and I still have this on my desk today, 28 years later!

                        I have a scarf from when I was younger that my mom gave me. 
                        I would sleep with it every night and even bring it during 
                        sleep away camps and sleepovers because it always brought me comfort. 
                        I still have it with me today because it holds a lot of sentimental value
                        and it makes me feel at home.
